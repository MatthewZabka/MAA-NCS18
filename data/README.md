2. In your browser, go to the following website: http://live.ripser.org/ 
3. Choose 'point cloud' from the drop-down menu.
4. Choose which dimensions you would like to check. (Try dimensions 0, 1, and 2)
5. Choose the maximum distance.
6. Choose the data set.
7. Discuss what the resulting barcodes tell you about the data's shape!
